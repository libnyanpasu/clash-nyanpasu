# Repository automation

Source is grouped under `src/`; tests live beside their modules. Runtime
settings and the dependency lockfile live here, while the root `deno.jsonc`
defines all public commands. Run `deno task` from the repository root to list
them.

See the [development guide](../docs/development/scripts.md) for categories, task
conventions, dependency handling and verification.

```sh
deno task prepare:check
deno task generate:git-info
deno task lint:deno
deno task lint:frontend-boundaries
deno task test:scripts
```
